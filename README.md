# HOGS CRM

This project is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and React. Follow the steps below to get started locally or build the project for deployment.

## Install Dependencies

First, install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server with hot reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at the URL displayed in the terminal.

## Build for Production

Create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command runs `vite build` and outputs the result to the `dist` directory.

When deploying (for example, to Vercel or any other hosting service), make sure the host serves the **contents** of the `dist` folder generated by the build step.
